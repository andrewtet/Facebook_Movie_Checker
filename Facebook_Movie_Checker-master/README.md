Facebook Movie Checker
======================

A Facebook extention that uses the Facebook SDK and FQL to check what movies your friends have liked and make recomnedations based on their choices.

This extention was taken down when Facebook made the change to require all apps to user HTTPS. While the app was fun to build, there was no way it is worth the cost of an SSL certificate.
